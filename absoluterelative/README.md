**<h3>Absolute Path</h3>**

  

- The top most dir in file system is root dir and starts with '/'. It is the full path to reach the file which is also called absolute path. It is the every step necessary from the beginning of filesystem to reach the file. For understanding, remember absolute path start with '/' or '\' depending upon the platform (linux, windows , maxc)

  
  

**<h3>Relative Path</h3>**

  

- It is the path from the current working directory. It is faster than absolute path since the path has less steps to follow. It is more easier and clean to use relative path, consider it more than absolute path.
